    "* Project Title: Reconsidering Maynard-Smith's Handicap Hypothesis\n",
    "* Brief Description: Here I consider a model of sexual selection proposed, and then rejected, in John Maynard Smith's 1976 paper, \"Sexual Selection and the Handicap Principle.\" In this paper, Maynard-Smith considers whether sex-linked \"handicaps\" can become fixed in a population due to their benefits to daughters, at the cost of sons (e.g. a female peacock who mates with a male with an elaborate tail will pass on the tail to her sons, which will lead to higher conspicousness to predators and hence higher mortality, but her daughters will receive no tail, plus the underlying 'good genes' that enabled the mate to survive with the tail). Maynard Smith used a very simiple pen-and-paper model to demonstrate that this sort of dynamic couldn't lead to the fixation of the handicap. Here I implement the model in python, and ask whether relaxing some of Maynard-Smith's assumptions could lead to a different outcome. "
